           <br>
        
            Hi, I‚Äôm Andy, I was born in Venda in Limpopo, but as a child, 
             My childhood was adventurous, and I was fortunate to visit many amazing places around the world.
             This left me with a passion for travel and culture that has stayed with me throughout my life.

<br>
<br>
Early on in my working career, I was a graphic designer.
 I naturally went into photography, as quality images were a must to create beautiful websites,
  brochures, and marketing material. 
I gained experience in commercial photography as well as beauty, fashion.
 <br>
 <br>
 As we needed original photographic material for our own marketing and website, 
 I used to take pictures during our events and give them to the couple as a gift.

          <p class="mb-5 text-muted">
          <br>
          <br>
   <strong>When choosing a photographer for your event:
     ‚ÄúFirst find a photographer whose photos you like and then see if you like the photographer!‚Äù</strong>
<br>
<br>
I have an editorial style of photography. I make everyone feel very relaxed whilst capturing elegant timeless images.
<br>
<br>
Personally, I do not believe you can photograph a wedding in one style of photography,
 you have to do them all. I especially enjoy using natural light while it is still available.
 However, once it is dark, I use my own lighting as there is no natural light at night!

  My job is to create a photographic record that tells the story of your  wedding with stunning photography.
   I prefer to photograph complete events from start to finish.

      <h3 class="mb-5 text-center">What I Photograph At Your Wedding</h3>
          <p class="mb-5 text-muted">
          If possible, I like to document the entire wedding from start to finish, 
          so I can give you comprehensive coverage of one of the most important days of your lives. 
          The location, details, getting ready, ceremony, drinks and reception,
           cake cutting, dancing, party, and more. My focus is on the people and fun!
<br>
<br>
Although I am well versed in many styles of photography.
 Still, my favorite is relaxed cinematic portraiture consisting of perfectly composed emotional portraits of you in love,
 in amazing locations with stunning light.

  <br>
  <br>
During the wedding, I leave you to enjoy your special day without having a photographer in your face.
 I prefer to work from a distance to capture the emotions and spontaneity between you and all the people attending.
  Most people say they were unaware of my presence.
 However, if necessary, I will guide you and do my best to make your day go perfectly.

          <p class="mb-5 text-muted">
            <br>
          For the group photos, I will speak up to call the required people and get the photos done as quickly as possible. I‚Äôm not too fond of stiff formals,
            so I will interact with you and get everyone to have fun with the groups, they don‚Äôt need to be a bunch of dull photos.
<br>
<br>
I speak English fluently and don‚Äôt mind helping out with translating if there are some language problems.
 If your wedding party is mixed with English and Venda speaking guests,
 that‚Äôs no problem, I can communicate with both.
  <br>
  <br>
I will accept shorter jobs, but I prefer to photograph your entire wedding because a storyteller,
 likes to tell the whole story and not just a part of it. Also, I would never undertake more than one job a day,
 so it doesn‚Äôt really make a difference if it requires 8 or 12 hours.
